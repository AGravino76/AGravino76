Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrew, I am a first-generation college student, and a freshman majoring in computer science at Cal Poly Pomona with interests in cyber security, cloud services, and software engineering. I intend to one day be able to contribute to the digital landscape by creating or aiding in projects that help streamline the difficulties in life. 

Currently, I am learning basic Java programming, problem solving, and discrete structures within computer science, implementing my knowledge into creating some games and simple projects. But soon, I will be able to perform advanced programming so I can make something that can possibly contribute to the world.

I am hoping to continue my skills and further have more experience under my belt by taking learning opportunities like joining projects that coincide with my ability to easily absorb information like constructive criticism and learn from my mistakes. Overall, I look towards all the possibilities that will come through each of the endeavors I will be faced with.
